# Microsoft Agent Framework

Microsoft Agent Framework is an SDK for building production-ready AI agents in application code. It gives you a consistent programming model for providers, sessions, tools, and orchestration.

For this lab, the sample in `labs/40-AIAgents/ms-agent-foundry/game_agent_v3_maf.py` runs a console agent against Azure OpenAI Responses through Agent Framework using Entra ID credentials.

## What It Is (and Is Not)

Microsoft Agent Framework is an application framework. It is not a hosted runtime by itself.

- It is: a code-first way to build agent behavior inside your app.
- It is not: a replacement for your app architecture, APIs, or data design.
- It is not: the same thing as Azure AI Foundry Agent Service.

Think of Agent Framework as the agent layer in your codebase that standardizes how your app talks to models, manages conversation state, and calls tools.

## Why Teams Use It

Teams typically adopt Agent Framework when they need:

- Consistent patterns across providers (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, and others).
- Explicit control over tool invocation and session continuity.
- Easier migration between simple chat, tool-enabled agents, and workflow orchestration.
- A path from prototype to production without rewriting the agent abstraction.

## Mental Model

Use this simple model when reading Agent Framework code:

- `Client`: How your app connects to a model API.
- `Agent`: The behavior layer (instructions, tools, middleware, options).
- `Session`: Conversation state that gives multi-turn continuity.
- `Run`: A single invocation that can use model reasoning and tools.

In short: client + agent configuration + session + run loop.

## Framework vs Service

- **Microsoft Agent Framework**: SDK and orchestration patterns in your app code.
- **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service**: Managed agent runtime and operations in Azure.

Use Agent Framework when you want code-level control over behavior and integration. Use Foundry Agent Service when you want more service-managed lifecycle and operations.

Practical decision rule:

- Choose **Agent Framework** if your app team owns behavior in source code and wants full integration control.
- Choose **Foundry Agent Service** if your team prefers managed lifecycle/operations and less runtime plumbing in app code.

## Core Concepts to Understand

### 1. Providers and Clients

Provider clients (for example `AzureOpenAIResponsesClient`) encapsulate API-specific details while exposing a common agent creation pattern.

### 2. Agent Definition

`client.as_agent(...)` defines agent identity, instructions, tools, and execution defaults. This is the central place where agent behavior is shaped.

### 3. Session Continuity

`agent.create_session()` gives you a session object that carries conversation context across turns. Reusing the same session is what makes follow-up questions coherent.

### 4. Tools

Tools are deterministic functions your agent can call. The model decides when to call them, but your app owns their implementation and side effects.

### 5. Orchestration

Your app still owns orchestration: input loop, policy checks, persistence, retries, and UX. Agent Framework standardizes the agent layer, not the full app stack.

## How the Sample Maps to Concepts

The current `game_agent_v3_maf.py` sample does the following:

- Creates `AzureOpenAIResponsesClient` with `project_endpoint`, deployment name, and `DefaultAzureCredential`.
- Creates one agent with `client.as_agent(...)`.
- Creates one session with `agent.create_session()` and reuses it for the full chat loop.
- Sends every non-empty user message with `await agent.run(user_input, session=session)`.
- Exits on `exit` or `quit`.

This is the minimum production-relevant pattern: one configured agent, one persistent session, repeated `run(...)` calls.

## Common Misunderstandings

- "The model remembers everything by default": Session continuity depends on passing the same session object.
- "Tools execute themselves": Tools are app functions; your app defines their logic and trust boundaries.
- "Framework and Foundry service are interchangeable": They solve adjacent but different concerns (code abstraction vs managed runtime).
- "Agent code replaces normal backend design": You still need API contracts, auth, data access rules, and observability.

## Create Microsoft Agent Framework Agent

- navigate to `labs/40-AIAgents/ms-agent-foundry`.

```bash
cd labs/40-AIAgents/ms-agent-foundry
```

- Create and activate a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv .maf
```
```bash
# Windows
source .maf/Scripts/activate
```
```bash
# macOS/linux
source .maf/bin/activate
```

- install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the sample.

```bash
python game_agent_v3_maf.py
```

Expected startup:

```text
============================================================
Microsoft Agent Framework - Game Agent
============================================================
You can:
  - Ask math questions (e.g., 'What is 15 + 27?')
  - Play Rock-Paper-Scissors (e.g., 'I choose rock')
  - Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end
============================================================

Using endpoint: <your endpoint>
Using model: gpt-4o

You:
```

## Provider Setup

This is the pattern used by the current sample:

```python
from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIResponsesClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

client = AzureOpenAIResponsesClient(
    project_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT"),
    deployment_name=os.getenv("AZURE_FOUNDRY_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME", "gpt-4o"),
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
)

agent = client.as_agent(
    name="GameAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful game assistant.",
)
```

## Sessions

Session continuity is built in when you pass the same session object on each turn:

```python
session = agent.create_session()

await agent.run("My name is Alex.", session=session)
result = await agent.run("What is my name?", session=session)
print(result)
```

## Extension A: Add Tools/Functions

Research validation: Agent Framework supports tool-enabled agents in code (official docs and package examples show `tools=[...]` usage).

Use this extension to let learners add helper functions for math and game resolution.

Paste this snippet at marker `INSERT-TOOLS-HERE` in `labs/40-AIAgents/ms-agent-foundry/game_agent_v3_maf.py`.

```python
from random import choice


def evaluate_math(
    expression: Annotated[str, Field(description="Simple arithmetic expression")],
) -> str:
    return str(eval(expression, {"__builtins__": {}}, {}))


def evaluate_rps(
    player_move: Annotated[str, Field(description="rock, paper, or scissors")],
) -> str:
    options = ("rock", "paper", "scissors")
    server_move = choice(options)
    winning_pairs = {
        ("rock", "scissors"),
        ("paper", "rock"),
        ("scissors", "paper"),
    }
    pm = player_move.lower().strip()
    if pm not in options:
        return "Invalid move. Use rock, paper, or scissors."
    if pm == server_move:
        winner = "tie"
    elif (pm, server_move) in winning_pairs:
        winner = "player"
    else:
        winner = "server"
    return f"player={pm}, server={server_move}, winner={winner}"


agent = client.as_agent(
    name="GameAgent",
    instructions=INSTRUCTIONS,
    tools=[evaluate_math, evaluate_rps],
)
```

After pasting, prompts like `Use evaluate_rps with my move scissors` can trigger tool usage with a random server move and a tool-calculated winner.

## Extension B: New Session Tool (Restart Game)

Research validation: `create_session()` and reusing `session=` in `run(...)` are supported and already used by this sample.

Paste this snippet at marker `INSERT-SESSION-CONTINUITY-HERE` in `labs/40-AIAgents/ms-agent-foundry/game_agent_v3_maf.py`.

```python
active_session_id = 1


def new_session():
    return agent.create_session()


def reset_session(current_id):
    return new_session(), current_id + 1
```

Then replace the existing session initialization line with:

```python
session = new_session()
```

Paste this snippet at marker `INSERT-NEW-SESSION-TOOL-HERE` in `labs/40-AIAgents/ms-agent-foundry/game_agent_v3_maf.py`.

```python
restart_requested = False


def new_session_tool() -> str:
    nonlocal restart_requested
    restart_requested = True
    return "New game requested. I will start a fresh session after this response."


agent = client.as_agent(
    name="GameAgent",
    instructions=INSTRUCTIONS,
    tools=[evaluate_math, evaluate_rps, new_session_tool],
)
```

Paste this snippet at marker `INSERT-NEW-SESSION-RESTART-HOOK-HERE` in `labs/40-AIAgents/ms-agent-foundry/game_agent_v3_maf.py`.

```python
if restart_requested:
    session, active_session_id = reset_session(active_session_id)
    restart_requested = False
    print(f"Started new game session #{active_session_id}")
    print()
```

With this flow, the user can ask the agent to call `new_session_tool` to restart the game without slash commands.
